# API Rate Limit Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations implemented to handle API rate limits in the stock analysis service, particularly for the Anthropic Claude API which has a limit of 5 requests per minute.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Rate Limiting

A `RateLimiter` class was implemented to manage the rate of API calls:

- Limits API calls to a maximum of 4 calls per minute (below the 5 calls/minute limit)
- Uses a token bucket algorithm to distribute calls evenly
- Automatically delays calls when the rate limit is approached
- Tracks call history to ensure compliance with the rate limit

### 2. Response Caching

A caching mechanism was implemented to store responses from the API:

- Caches responses based on the method name and prompt
- Uses time-based expiration for different types of data:
  - Stock prices: 1 hour
  - Industry peers: 24 hours
  - P/E ratios: 24 hours
- Significantly reduces the number of API calls for repeated requests

### 3. Query Optimization

Several optimizations were made to reduce the number of API calls:

- Combined multiple queries into single prompts where possible
- Made risk analysis optional and only performed when explicitly requested
- Optimized the `analyze_risk` method to use a single API call instead of multiple calls
- Implemented fallback mechanisms to use alternative data sources when possible

### 4. Integration with Polygon API

The `PolygonFinancials` class was updated to:

- Use the caching mechanism from the `StockAnalyzer` class
- Cache industry peers, prices, and P/E ratios
- Implement multiple fallback approaches for retrieving data
- Only use the Claude API as a last resort when other methods fail

## Testing

A test script (`test_rate_limiting.py`) was created to verify the optimizations:

- Tests caching for repeated calls to the same method
- Tests rate limiting for multiple different calls
- Tests integration with the `PolygonFinancials` class
- Measures performance improvements from caching

## Usage Guidelines

To ensure optimal performance and stay within API rate limits:

1. Always use the `StockAnalyzer` instance for making API calls
2. Pass the `StockAnalyzer` instance to the `PolygonFinancials` class
3. Use the optional `include_risk_analysis` parameter in API routes to avoid unnecessary API calls
4. Monitor the rate limiter statistics during development to ensure compliance
